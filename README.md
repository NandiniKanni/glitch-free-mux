🌀 Glitch-Free MUX – Verilog
This repository contains a Verilog implementation of a Glitch-Free Multiplexer (MUX). It also includes a testbench and a simulation waveform. This MUX provides clean signal switching, important where you don't want any temporary weird signals when you change inputs.

📁 Files Included
glitch_free_mux.v – Simple MUX code
glitch_free_mux_tb.v – Testbench for the MUX
glitch_free_waveform.png – Simulation waveform output 


📌 Notes
Design made and simulated using ModelSim.
MUX confirmed to switch without glitches.
